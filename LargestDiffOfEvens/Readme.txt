If there are fewer than 2 even numbers in the array, largestDifferenceOfEvens should return -1.

If you are programming in Java or C#, the function signature is

int largestDifferenceOfEvens(int[ ] a)

If you are programming in C or C++, the function signature is
int largestDifferenceOfEvens(int a[ ], int len) where len is the number of elements in the array a.
