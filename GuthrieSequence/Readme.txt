Question 20
Consider the following algorithm
- Start with a positive number n
- if n is even then divide by 2
- if n is odd then multiply by 3 and add 1
-* continue this until n becomes 1

The Guthrie sequence of a positive number n is defined to be the numbers generated by the above algorithm.

For example, the Guthrie sequence of the number 7 is
7, 22, 11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1
It is easy to see that this sequence was generated from number 7 by the above algorithm.
Since 7 is odd, multiply by 3 and add 1 to get 22 which is the second number of the sequence.
Since 22 is even, divide by 2 to get 11 which is the third number of the sequence.
11 is odd, multiply by 3 and add 1 to get 34 which is the fourth number of the sequence and so on.

Note: the first number of a Guthrie sequence is always the number that generated the sequence and
the last number is always 1.

Write a function named isGuthrieSequence which returns 1 if the elements of the array form a
Guthrie sequence. Otherwise, it returns 0.
If you are programming in Java or c#, the function signature is
int isGuthrieSequence(int[] a)

| {8,17,4,1}              | 0        | This is not the Guthrie sequence for 8                     |

|-------------------------|----------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| {8,4,2}                 | 0        | A Guthrie sequence must end with 1                         |
