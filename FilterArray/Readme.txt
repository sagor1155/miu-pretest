Filter array
An array is defined to be a Filter array if it meets the following conditions

a. If it contains 9 then it also contains 11.

b. If it contains 7 then it does not contain 13.

So {1, 2, 3, 9, 6, 11} and {3, 4, 6, 7, 14, 16}, {1, 2, 3, 4, 10, 11, 13} and {3, 6, 5, 5, 13, 6, 13} 
are Filter arrays. 
The following arrays are not Filter arrays: {9, 6, 18} (contains 9 but no 11), 
{4, 7, 13} (contains both 7 and 13) 
Write a function named isFilter that returns 1 if its array argument is a Filter array, otherwise it returns 0.

If you are programming in Java or C#, the function signature is

int isFilter(int[ ] a)

If you are programming in C or C++, the function signature is

int isFilter(int a[ ], int len) where len is the number of elements in the array
