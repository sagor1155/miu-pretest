A Fibonacci number is a number in the sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21,â€¦. Note that first two
Fibonacci numbers are 1 and any Fibonacci number other than the first two is the sum ofthe
previous two Fibonacci numbers. For example, 2 = 1 + 1, 3 = 2 + 1, 5 = 3 + 2 and so on.
Write a function named isFibonacci that returns 1 if its integer argument is a Fibonaccinumber,
otherwise it returns 0.
The signature of the function is
int isFibonacci (int n)
