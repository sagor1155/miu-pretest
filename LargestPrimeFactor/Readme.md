Write a function named largestPrimeFactor that will return the largest prime factor of a number. 
If the number is <=1 it should return 0. Recall that a prime number 
is a number > 1 that is divisible only by 1 and itself, e.g., 13 is prime but 14 is not.

The signature of the function is int largestPrimeFactor(int n)

Examples:
n       return
10      5           because the prime factors of 10 are 2 and 5 and 5 is the largest one.
6936    17          because the distinct prime factors of 6936 are 2, 3 and 17 and 17 is the largest
1       0           because n must be greater than 1
