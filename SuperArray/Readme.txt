29 Super array
An Super array is defined to be an array in which each element is greater than sum of all elements
before that. See examples below: {2, 3, 6, 13} is a Super array.
Note that 2 < 3, 2+3 < 6, 2 + 3 + 6 < 13. {2, 3, 5, 11} is a NOT a Super array.
Note that 2 + 3 not less than 5. 
Write a function named isSuper that returns 1 if its array argument is a isSuper array,
otherwise it returns 0. If you are programming in Java or C#, the function signature is:

int isSuper (int [ ] a)

If you are programming in C or C++, the function signature is:

int isSuper (int a[ ], int len)

where len is the number of elements in the array
