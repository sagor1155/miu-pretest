30 Bunker array
A Bunker array is an array that contains the value 1 if and only if it contains a prime number. 
The array {7, 6, 10, 1} is a Bunker array because it contains a prime number (7) and also contains a 1. 
The array {7, 6, 10} is not a Bunker array because it contains a prime number (7) but does not contain a 1. 
The array {6, 10, 1} is not a Bunker array because it contains a 1 but does not contain a prime number.
It is okay if a Bunker array contains more than one value 1 and more than one prime,
so the array {3, 7, 1, 8, 1} is a Bunker array (3 and 7 are the primes). 
Write a function named isBunker that returns 1 if its array argument is a Bunker array and 
returns 0 otherwise. You may assume the existence of a function named isPrime that returns 1
if its argument is a prime and returns 0 otherwise. You do not have to write isPrime, you can just call it.
If you are programming in Java or C#, the function signature is

int isBunker(int [ ] a)

If you are programming in C or C++, the function signature is

int isBunker(int a[ ], int len) where len is the number of elements in the array
