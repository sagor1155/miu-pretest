goodSpread
Write a function called goodSpread that returns 1 if no value in its array argument occurs more than 3 times in the array.
For example, goodSpread(new int[] {2, 1, 2, 5, 2, 1, 5, 9}) returns 1 because no value occurs more than three times.
But goodSpread(new int[ ] {3, 1, 3 ,1, 3, 5, 5, 3} ) returns 0 because the value 3 occurs four times.

If you are writing in Java or C#, the function signature is

int goodSpread (int[ ] a)

If you are writing in C or C++, the function signature is

int goodSpread (int a[ ], int len) where len is the number of elements in the array.
